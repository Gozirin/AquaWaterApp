# Aqua

Aqua product is an android application designed in an attempt to facilitate access to water supply. This application provides a platform for water vendors and merchants to efficiently provide water to customers, as well as track managing customers on a single platform. Clients or customers do not have to physically get refilled water dispensers but can reach out to their suppliers online, make orders and purchase.
